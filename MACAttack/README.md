# MAC Attack Lab

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Unpack the script from the zip file and load the dev container.

2. Update the mac located at the top of sha1.py by replacing it with the one given by the passoff server.

```
# ================CHANGE MAC HERE===================
MAC = 0x<MAC from passoff>
# ==================================================
```

3. Run the following command

```
python3 sha1.py
```

This will run all of the tests and print them to stdout.
