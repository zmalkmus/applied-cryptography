# cs583_aes

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy, 

You can unpack the script from the zip file, or you can use github to install it with

```
git clone https://github.com/zmalkmus/cs583_aes.git
```

Then, just load the dev container and run the following command

```
python3 aes.py
```

This will run all of the tests and print them to stdout.

## Statement

I have only used the resources listed in the lab writeup. I have not discussed the lab with anyone other than the professor and the TA. I have not copied any code from any source.

## Appendix C

I currently pass all of the tests in appendix c. Output.txt was generated by piping the output of aes.py.
